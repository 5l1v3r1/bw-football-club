## Project Management

:briefcase: This project is managed on Pivotal Tracker [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2403959)

## Technologies used :gem:

- Angular v8 (Modern Single Page Application Framework) - I used this to build out the app
- Bootstrap 4 (Modern CSS framework) - I used this for responsive web design
- Fontawesome (icon library) - I used this for a couple of icons
- NgxSpinner (loader library) - I used this for displaying a customised loader
- Express (Nodejs framework) - I used this to serve the frontend on the heroku server

## Extras :tada:

Out of 7 days it has taken me 6 days to get to this point in the project, the hardest part was trying to mimick the banner overlay as seen in the figma design. I am proud of the project as a whole, but I think the best is making the whole site responsive and adding a visual customized loader :bowtie: .

## Angular CLI Version

:heart_decoration: This project was generated with Angular CLI version 8.3.8.
